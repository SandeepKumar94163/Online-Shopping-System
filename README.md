An online shopping website built using Java, JSP, HTML, and CSS provides users with a platform to browse, view, and purchase products. It features user registration, login, a product catalog, detailed product pages, a shopping cart, and a checkout system. Java handles backend business logic, while JSP dynamically generates pages. Servlets manage requests, and JDBC is used for database connectivity to store user, product, and order information. The admin panel allows for product and order management. This project demonstrates Java-based web application development, especially for e-commerce functionalities.
